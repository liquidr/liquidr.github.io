<dt>Sept 18, 2012</dt><dd>"Realtime" streaming is now supported.  If you add "&stream" to a data fetch URL,
any fetch via that URL will "hang" when the server has transmitted all known samples.  As new samples arrive from
the instrument, they will be written by the server to the client.
Streaming URLs are great for avoiding polling: they get data as soon as possible, without the overhead
of making frequent HTTP requests.
<p>
Normally, the client will never get an
end-of-file when reading from a streaming URL.  But there are situations where the connection may
be closed (server reboot, network configuration change, ....).  If you get an EOF while reading a streaming
URL, just start reading again.  New samples will be recieved by the client a couple
of minutes after the sensor takes its reading, on average.  Most of the delay is in the Iridium satellite network.</dd>
